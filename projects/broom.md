**TL;DR** Broom is a <!--paid ($15 USD)--> browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that lets
you scrape data from a web page up into a CSV or JSON file.

Broom was born out of the desire to quickly assemble data from sites that do not
expose an API into a spreadsheet, without wanting to spend time setting up a
full scraper for short one time tasks.

When activated by a button it places in the browsers toolbar, it provides a
visual click based interface to set up the configuration, make it aware of
pagination links and then lets you scrape the number of pages that you desire.
When finally done, it'll provide the choice of a CSV, JSON and a "Columnar
JSON" format download.

## Technology
- Svelte, Typescript, Tailwind CSS all bundled together with Rollup.js

## Neat Details
- Broom has my best library approach to RPC inside of web extensions yet, I'm
  pretty proud of it
- Broom uses Svelte integration with Web Components to inject it's UI into a
  webpage in a isolated fashion, a nice upgrade from the iframe setup
  I've used in previous extensions
