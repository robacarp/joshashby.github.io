**TL;DR** Raton is a minimal RSS feed reader designed to let you read the feeds
and get out of your way, packaged as a browser extension.

RSS *never really* died, for most sites it just slipped into the background but
is still used. I couldn't find a small and lightweight reader that sat well
with me and just got out of the way so, naturally, the only solution was to write
my own.

## Technology
- Svelte, Typescript, Tailwind CSS all bundled together with Rollup.js
- Stores feeds in IndexDB, leaning on Dexie.js for a nicer interface
- Home-rolled feed parser library using the browsers built in DOM and JSON API's

## Neat Details
- Raton's keyboard binding system makes use of a Trie (aka a Prefix Tree) for
  fast but configurable and sequenced keyboard shortcuts.
