In the [previous post](/2021/10/16/web-extensions-with-rollup-getting-started.html), we laid down the groundwork for building a browser extension using [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) that logged "Hello, World!" out to the extensions background page's console. Today we'll take that idea a little further and start to tie into the browser's "Omnibox," which will let the browser give our extension the users input into the URL bar after they've entered a keyword with which we'll register in the extensions `manifest.json`. As part of this, we'll set up TypeScript, 

As a reminder of what we're building through this series: A simple browser extension that allows for the creation of "aliases" via the URL bar, e.g., if the browser extension registers `goto` as the keyword, the user could set up the alias `github/me` to go to their GitHub profile and type in `goto github/me` to the URL bar to make use of the alias; Similar to [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector).

Along the way, we'll cover an introduction to browser extensions, talk about making them function under both Chrome and Firefox with minimal changes and how to use tools like Rollup.js to help bundle one.

While I'm writing these posts using my own preferences on techniques and technologies (which include Rollup.js as well as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)), there are a lot of alternative approaches, and it's the concepts that are the core take away. Nothing precludes you from using different technologies; if you'd like to follow along using Vanilla ES6+ and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), or any other number of setups, {% aside go right ahead! | purple %}
For example, I've been meaning to mess around with [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) or [Rescript w/ React](https://rescript-lang.org/). Maybe even replace Rollup.js with esbuild or [swc](https://swc.rs/). All of which shouldn't be too difficult to adapt this series for.

### TypeScript

As I eluded to above, this step is optional. Still, I personally find that TypeScript (TS) makes it easier for me to come back to projects after a long hiatus, helps eliminate several common bug types resulting from duck typing and generally helps speed up my development. TypeScript is easy to convert to JavaScript by removing the types (the occasional enum might need some tweaks to make it an object, too, but that shouldn't be a show stopper). Even if TypeScript is not your cup of tea, it should be easy to follow along still.

We'll need both TypeScript as well as the Rollup TypeScript plugin:

```bash
npm add --save-dev @rollup/plugin-typescript typescript
```

Then we'll need to add the plugin to our `rollup.config.js`, add the import somewhere near the top:

{% source javascript hl_lines="3" %}
import copy from "rollup-plugin-copy"

import typescript from "@rollup/plugin-typescript"

const production = !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH
{% endsource %}

And set up the plugin after the `commonjs` plugin:

{% source javascript hl_lines="4" %}
      resolve({ browser: true, preferBuiltins: false }),
      commonjs(),

      typescript({ sourceMap: !production, inlineSources: !production }),

      copy({
{% endsource %}

We're configuring the source maps to generate in development builds and telling TypeScript to [inline the original TS source](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#inlineSources) into the source map. I find the inlining of the source helps the browsers to be able to display the source and line/column numbering {% aside without issue. %}Without needing to set up a source directory mapping, something I've never had function well. YMMV. {% endaside %}

Next, we'll add the start of our `tsconfig.json`. You can do this in several ways, such as running `npm exec tsc -- --init`, but I have a starter version that I use, which closely aligns with the Svelte TSConfig (which we'll make use of in a future post) and plays nicely with Rollup:

```json
{
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules/*",
    "dist/*",
    "web-ext/*",
    "ext-dev/*"
  ],
  "include": [ "src/**/*.ts" ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "es2020",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

For a reference on all the options available, please refer to the [`tsconfig.json` docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).

We'll need to also adjust our `src/background/index.js` to be a TypeScript file. Rename it to `src/background/index.ts`, then add `export default undefined` to the end. You might want to change up the `console.log` message as well if you'd like to see that TypeScript is working.

Why do we need `export default undefined`? We've configured TypeScript with [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules) turned on, which we'll need for Svelte in future posts as the Svelte pre-processor that handles TypeScript in Svelte files only works on a file-by-file basis and, as the `isolatedModules`  docs say:

> [...] other transpilers only operate on a single file at a time, which means they can't apply code transforms that depend on understanding the full type system.

Without this, you might see this warning pop up in the Rollup output:

```
rollup v2.52.7
bundles src/background/index.ts → dist/background...
(!) Plugin typescript: @rollup/plugin-typescript TS1208: 'index.ts' cannot be compiled under '--isolatedModules' because it is considered a global script file. Add an import, export, or an empty 'export {}' statement to make it a module.
src/background/index.ts: (1:1)

1 console.log("Hello, World! From TS!")
  ~~~~~~~

created dist/background in 1s

[2021-10-23 20:12:54] waiting for changes...
```

One last change that we need to make is to change the extension in the `input` for the background page's entry point to `.ts` so that Rollup can find the file correctly:

{% source javascript hl_lines="3" %}
export default [
  {
    input: "src/background/index.ts",
    output: {
      sourcemap: !production,
      dir: "dist/background/",
      format: "esm",
    },
{% endsource %}

Now `npm run start:rollup` should run without issue, and {% aside reloading the extension %}
In Firefox, the debugging page that we used to load the extension in the previous post, `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, will display a small "Reload" button on the bottom right corner of the extensions card:

![](/assets/2021-10-22-browser-extension-with-rollup-omnibox-chatter/firefox-reload.png)

For Chrome, the extensions page that we used to load the unpacked extension, `chrome://extensions/`, will display a small "Reload" _icon_ button on the bottom right corner of the extensions card:

![](/assets/2021-10-22-browser-extension-with-rollup-omnibox-chatter/chrome-reload.png)

{%endaside %} in your browser should cause your `console.log` message to show up as before:

![](/assets/2021-10-22-browser-extension-with-rollup-omnibox-chatter/typescript-console.png)

Not only that, the browser should correctly show the original filename, `index.ts` and even the original TS file's source!

### Polyfills

Before we get any further, we're going to add a polyfill for the browser extensions API that Mozilla provides, allowing us to use the `browser` promise-based APIs, even while running the browser extension in Chrome.

Why do we need such a thing, you might ask? Great question! As it turns out, Chrome's browser extension API is an {% aside older generation %}The OG, in fact!{% endaside %} and makes use of a `chrome` namespace (ie: `chrome.storage.sync`) which uses callbacks for async operations.

**Record Scratch** Yes, I did just say "callbacks for async operations." Yes, we're in a post ES6 world where JavaScript has [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and `async`/`await` keywords for working with them in a friendly, _synchronous like_ fashion that solves a significant amount of the problems that lead to, and result from, Callback Hell.

On the other hand, Firefox ships with a {% aside more modern %}And maybe soon [standards track](https://www.w3.org/community/webextensions/){% endaside %}, generation of the original Chrome API. This version lives under the `browser` namespace and uses promises for async operations. Thankfully, the fine folks at Mozilla maintain a [polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) for Chrome which allows you to use the `browser` and promise-based API's so we can write modern code once that runs on both browsers.

Add it to our dependencies with `npm add` like always (I'm not saving it under the dev dependencies this time, as it's a required runtime module that we'll actively import into our code):

```bash
npm add webextension-polyfill
```

To test it out, we'll make use of the [`browser.runtime.id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/id) call in our `console.log`, which should print out a nice random string that {% aside represents the ID of the extension. %}This is customizable in Firefox, via the `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` property of the manifest, the docs for which are [found here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings).{% endaside %} Update `src/background/index.ts` file to look like the following:

```typescript
import browser from "webextension-polyfill"

console.log(`Hello, World! From TS! ${browser.runtime.id}`)
```

	
#### The Trouble with ~~Tribbles~~ Types

If you're using TypeScript, you might notice this fun warning show up in the Rollup output, and you might have an error in your editor for the same issue:

```
(!) Plugin typescript: @rollup/plugin-typescript TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'webextension-polyfill'. '/Users/joshashby/repos/personal/svelte-web-extension-tutorial/node_modules/webextension-polyfill/dist/browser-polyfill.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm i --save-dev @types/webextension-polyfill` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'webextension-polyfill';`
```

This is where I found things get a little hairy right now. There are a [couple of](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/webextension-polyfill) [packges](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext-types) that supply types for the `browser` API's and for the {% aside polyfill %}`@types/webextension-polyfill` Sounds great at first, but I've found it has some missing or oddly typed APIs and many instances of various objects being a nebulous `any`, which isn't super helpful for a well-defined set of APIs like this.{% endaside %}, however the most complete and up-to-date one that I use is [`@types/firefox-webext-browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/firefox-webext-browser):

```bash
npm add --save-dev @types/firefox-webext-browser
```

Unfortunately, installing this package doesn't get you very far. The import error for `webextension-polyfill` will remain, as this package only declares types for a global `browser` object. This also has the downside of TypeScript thinking `browser` is defined, regardless of if you've remembered to import `webextension-polyfill` or not. So how do we get around this?

Well ... We hack it. This is the real ugly bit and abuses TypeScript a bit, but we're going to make an [ambient definition](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html#working-with-other-javascript-libraries), by creating a `src/polyfill-types.d.ts` file with the following contents:

```typescript
import type browser from "@types/firefox-webext-browser"

declare module "webextension-polyfill" {
  export default browser
}
```

We use an ambient `.d.ts` file since TypeScript will pick it up without any additional work from us, and we define the default export of the polyfill as being typed by the type export of the `@types/firefox-webext-browser` package.

With this out of the way, the TypeScript warning should resolve, and reloading the extension should yield our new `console.log` message:

```
Hello, World! From TS! e7f1b7ad5057a435952272be6270dbf6b16867fe@temporary-addon
```

### So, What's the Omnibox?

Now that we have our polyfill in place (and some of you have TypeScript up and running), we can get on with our original goal for today: Integrating with the [Omnibox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/omnibox) (The Omnibox might be more recognizable to you as the URL bar) and browser extensions are allowed to register a keyword with the browser, which, when typed into the Omnibox, will cause the browser to begin sending the contents of the Omnibox to your extension.

To get started, we'll follow the directions of the Omnibox docs and add an `omnibox` section to our `manifest.json`, where we'll also {% aside define our keyword. %}I chose `vrm`, short for `vroom`, but this can be just about any word{% endaside %}

{% source json hl_lines="4 5 6" %}
  "background": {
    "page": "background/index.html"
  },
  "omnibox": {
    "keyword": "vrm"
  }
}
{% endsource %}

With this in place, we can now start hooking up to the `omnibox` API. We'll use the extension's background page to register event listeners and handle the subsequent events since the background page will run at all times and has the highest level of permissions for accessing parts of the browser extension API.

This API {% aside is event-driven %}The browser extension APIs where an extension might react to something happening in the browser are all exposed as events, using the same interface consisting of the functions `addEventListener`, `hasEventListener`/`hasEventListeners` and `removeEventListener`, which all take a callback function which is the event subscriber.{% endaside %}, and in particular, for the `omnibox`, there are 4 events we can listen for:

- `onInputStarted` Called with no arguments when the user has typed in the full keyword followed by a space
- `onInputChanged` Called with the current input and a callback that allows setting suggestions
- `onInputEntered` Called when the user accepts one of the suggestions
- `onInputCancelled` Called when the user escapes/closes the omnibox 

We'll only use `onInputChanged` and `onInputEntered` for our extension, but to demonstrate the others and get a sense of how this API works, we'll add some basic logging. Add the following to the end of `src/background/index.ts`:

```typescript
browser.omnibox.onInputStarted.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Input started")
})

browser.omnibox.onInputChanged.addListener((input, suggest) => {
  console.log(`Input changed! ${input}`)
  
  suggest([
    { content: "s1", description: "This is suggestion 1" },
    { content: "s2", description: "This is suggestion 2" },
    { content: "s3", description: "This is suggestion 3" },
    { content: "s4", description: "This is suggestion 4" },
  ])
})

browser.omnibox.onInputEntered.addListener((suggestion, disposition) => {
  console.log(`Input entered! ${suggestion} should open in ${disposition}`)
})

browser.omnibox.onInputCancelled.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Input cancelled")
})
```

After reloading the extension, by typing in your keyword to the URL bar, you should trigger the logging statements and see the suggestions we put in place.

![](/assets/2021-10-22-browser-extension-with-rollup-omnibox-chatter/chrome-omnibox-console.png)

The heart of what we'll be expanding upon in future posts of this series is this little bit with `suggest` here:

{% source typescript hl_lines="4 5 6 7 8 9" %}
browser.omnibox.onInputChanged.addListener((text, suggest) => {
  console.log(`Input changed! ${text}`)
  
  suggest([
    { content: "s1", description: "This is suggestion 1" },
    { content: "s2", description: "This is suggestion 2" },
    { content: "s3", description: "This is suggestion 3" },
    { content: "s4", description: "This is suggestion 4" },
  ])
})
{% endsource %}

Listeners for `onInputChanged` receive two arguments, `text` and `suggest`. `text` is the full text, minus the keyword and space, that the user has typed, while `suggest` is a callback that accepts an array of [`SuggestResult`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/omnibox/SuggestResult). A `SuggestResult` is just an object with two properties, `content` and `description`. `description` is, understandably, only for the users, however `content` represents the actual "value" of the suggestion, and if the user were to accept that suggestion, `content` is what the extension will receive in it's `onInputEntered` listener.

In the future, we'll use this bit of knowledge to build out our alias functionality, displaying matching aliases and the URL that they map to as the description.

## Wrapping Up

We laid down some good foundations for building our extension, but it still doesn't do much; Currently, it registers a keyword with the browser for the Omnibox and prints out the events to the console. In the next post, we'll finish the last bit of setup for a while: installing and configuring Svelte, and then use it to make a basic settings page. After that, we'll be able to start interacting with the browser extension `storage` APIs to read/write our aliases. Finally, we'll be able to hook up our work here with the `omnibox` API to our new settings to be able to suggest, and act upon, those aliases!
